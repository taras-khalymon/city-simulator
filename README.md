City traffic simulator
We want to make a city traffic simulator to watch the dynamics of moving cars to make decisions about car's next actions. For this we should make a mathematical model of this transport system. This model is graph. Information about real cities will be token from open street maps. And traffic will be simulated randomly, before we'll found a source of information about it.
		TODO
Realize a model of transport system (as graph)
Visualize it
Make a manual map editor
Make a traffic control system
Make an ability to load maps from source (open street maps)
Make traffic monitoring ability
Make some statistic features (related to monitoring)
